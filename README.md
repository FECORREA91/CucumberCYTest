Cypress POM Project with Cucumber and JavaScript

This project is a test automation suite built with Cypress, Cucumber, and JavaScript, following the Page Object Model (POM) architecture for better code organization and maintenance. The project targets the Magento demo site: Magento Testing Board.

📋 Why Use These Technologies?

Cypress

Fast, reliable, and easy to set up.

Provides real-time reloading and interactive debugging.

Rich set of built-in commands for browser automation.

Cucumber (Gherkin)

Enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with human-readable test scenarios.

Facilitates collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

JavaScript

Widely used language with a vast ecosystem.

Easily integrates with frontend technologies.

Page Object Model (POM)

Encourages code reusability and maintainability.

Separates test logic from UI interactions, reducing duplication.
